SCRAP
-----

* What it is

SCRAP (Security Camera Recording APplication) is a security camera recording application for Linux.

* Capabilities

SCRAP is capable of working with any video4linux compatible device,
supporring all of its documented features. It can grab frames from multiple
inputs of a single device and also support working with multiple capture
boards at the same time, giving user the advantage of a low-cost recording
system.

It has a very reliable motion detection system, recording only when movement
happens and ignoring the rest, including light changes. So, in a tipical 24h
recording cycle, you will have only a few hours of recorded video.

Videos are recorded using XviD's MPEG-4 compression, witch is one of the best
video codecs today. The generated AVIs should be playable on any AVI+MPEG4
capable video player (all modern video players are).

There is also a recording archive management system, with alow the user keep
archived only recent recordings, erasing the old ones. User can set to erase
recordings older than a number of days, or set a maximum disk usage.
