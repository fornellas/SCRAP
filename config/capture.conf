# Input #
#########
# channel
# Channel of the capture board to acquire frames. Usually capture boards have
# more than one channel: Television, Composite1, S-Video and Composite3 for
# example. For each channel, a number is assigned, starting from 0. In the
# example, Television would be channel 0, Composite1 channel 1 and so on.
# Can be integer number, >=0
# Default: 0
channel=0
# norm
# The norm for this channel:
# 0=PAL
# 1=NTSC
# 2=SECAM
# 3=AUTO
# Default: 3
norm=3
# tuner
# Boards can have none, one or more tuners atached to each channel, numbered
# from 0 to maximum avaliable (try scrap -d /dev/video to check this out).
# Specify a tuner here to enable tunning, acoording to parameters below in
# this section. Set to -1 to usable uner usage.
# Default: -1
tuner=-1
# mode
# If "tuner" is set, then this will select the video mode to tune:
# 0=PAL
# 1=NTSC
# 2=SECAM
# 3=AUTO
# Default: 3
# PS: may overwrite above parameter norm
mode=3
# freq
# If above "tuner" is set, you may use this.
# If the input signal is a TV signal, you can choose the frequency to tune.
# Tuning frequencies are from 1 to 4294967296, in steps of 1/16 (16 means
# 1kHz/MHz). Note that this range is not for all cards, many cards will have
# smaller ranges.
# If you see:
#      Frequency is in a lower range:            Yes
# when running
# $ scrap -d /dev/video
# for the selected tuner, frequencies are in kHz, otherwise frequencies are in
# MHz.
# Not all boards support this feature.
# Set freq to 0 to disable frequency setting.
# Default: 0
freq=0

# width

# height
# Height of the captured frames.
# Default: 288
height=288
# Usually, captured frames comes with a black border. The next 4 items, let you
# crop it, selecting a window inside the captured frame. So, you can capture a
# frame with a resolution, crop it, and store with a lower resolution, without
# the black borders.
# The default is to adjust window settings to englobe full frame.
#
# window_x
# X co-ordinate of beginning of capture window.
# Default: 0

# window_y
# Y co-ordinate of beginning of capture window.

# window_width
# Width of captured window.
# Default: width-window_x

# window_height
# Height of captured window.
# Default: height-window_y

# gray 1|0
# Capture and encode in grayscale mode.
#   0: Color capture
#   1: Grayscale capture

# Motion detection #
####################
# motion_detection_algorithm
# Motion detection algorithm to use.
# 0: None
#    No motion detection is performed, and all frames are stored.
# 1: Difference
#    Detects motion by substracting the current frame from the comparation
#    frame. Detects *ANY* changes in the image.
# 2: Derivate difference
#    As above, but it derivate each frame before substracting. It is VERY less
#    susceptable to light changes, but consumes more CPU.
# See next options, to tune the algorithms.
# Default: 1
motion_detection_algorithm=1
# half_image
# If set to 1, makes motion detection algorithm process only odd vertical lines
# of the image. Use ONLY if your system is too slow to process the full frame.
# Default: 0
half_image=0
# deriv_diff_full
# If motion detection algorithm is set to "derivate difference", then this
# parameter can tune it. Setting to 1, makes the algorithm, for each pixel,
# calculate the derivate including all the eight surrounding pixels. Set to 0
# to use only two neighbours pixels. It is recommend to use full algotighm, to
# get better results. One more time, set to 0 only if your system is slow.
# Default: 1
deriv_diff_full=1
# force_obsolete_sec
# Motion is detected between the current captured frame and a comparation frame.
# This item, let you tune the comparation frame. By default (0), the comparation
# frame is set obsolete, and substituted by the current frame, only when motion
# is detected. You can force the comparation frame to be discarted after
# force_obsolete_sec seconds, even if no motion is detected. This is useful to
# avoid detecting day light changes as movement. If this happens, try setting
# force_obsolete_sec to a few minutes.
# Default: 0
force_obsolete_sec=0
# threshold
# Motion is detected, if a percentage of the image bigger than threshold has
# changed. It is a good idea to set it to a very low value.
# Default: 0.5%
threshold=0.5
# noise
# Captured frames have a color/luminosity flutuation, even if the camera is in
# a dark room. This noise must me disconsidered for motion detection. Usually it
# is a low value (arround 8). Noise range is from 0 to 255.
# Default: 10
noise=10
# calibrate
# This parameters help you tune threshold and noise values. Set to 1 to output
# only the pixels changed (equal pixels are painted black), or 2 to output the
# difference frame (just for fun). Also enable output for all frames (even
# without motion detected).
# Default: 0
calibrate=0
################
# Memory usage #
################
# frame_buffer_size
# If system can not process data captured in real time, the frames will be
# buffered into memory, to later processing. This is important under system's
# high load peaks.
# The default is to buffer at most 10 frames (buffer size depends on frame size
# settings). You can set the maximum size of the buffer in MegaBytes.

# xvid_quant
# Constant XviD quantizer value. This number express the difference between the
